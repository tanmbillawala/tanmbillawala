- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanmbillawala
- 👀 I’m interested in getting hands-on experience with coding projects, specifically targeting artificial intelligence / machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open project that is accessible to a beginner/intermediate level coder. 
- 📫 How to reach me: tanmbillawala@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am graduate with a degree in mathematics. I took a few CS classes and am now pursuing a Master's in AI (as somewhat of a side quest).
I am perhaps not the best coder YET but I learn fast :)
